Cyber Link Lock
Final Year Project

Cyber Link Lock is a web-based security tool that protects URLs using password encryption. When a user opens an encrypted link, they must enter the correct password to access the original website.

All data is stored inside the link itself. No servers, databases, cookies, or tracking are used. This ensures privacy, security, and full user control.

This project demonstrates practical use of encryption techniques in cybersecurity and safe link sharing.
